# Archipelago.RetroArchClient - TODO Document

---
## TODOs:<br/>
- [ ] LocationCheckService, Line 465 - "need to document and figure this out more."
- [ ] RetroArchCommandStringUtils.cs, Line 6 - "add checks that look for error messages, the number after the address is -1 if it's an error, so detecting that case shouldn't be too hard"
---
## Features that should be investigated:<br/>
- [ ] Client gives feedback to user on Item Sent/Item Received. Possible implementation of how this could look like:<br/>"{Player} found {Other Player}'s {Item} at {Location}" or "{Player} found their {Item} at {Location}"
- [ ] Client should give feedback if an exception has occured so the user can understand what went wrong and report a crash to us later this way.
---
## Planned for the future:
- [ ] Avalonia UI Build of the Client
- [ ] General BizHawk support
